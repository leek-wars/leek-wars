## Deployment

The project is very easy to install and deploy in 10s:

git clone https://github.com/leek-wars/leek-wars-client.git
cd leek-wars-client
npm i
npm run serve
```
Then go to `localhost:8080` in your browser.

*Be careful*, this project is only the front end of Leek Wars, so it's connected to the
production server. When you log into this local version, you will use your real account!
