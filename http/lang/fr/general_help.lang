challenges			Challenges
challenges_1			You can Challenge any other leek.
To do so, go on the page of the leek you want to fight against and click on the "Challenge" button located in the upper right. You are allowed up to 200 Challenges per day.
challenges_2			Challenges reward no Experience point nor Habs. Challenges do not add up to the total of your wins, draws and losses (ratio).
chips			Chips
chips_1			Chips have different purposes: damage, healing, boost, shields, shackles, moving...
chips_2			Each chip requests a minimum level to be used. The use of a chip costs a specific amount of Turn Points. Each type of chip has a specific failure percentage, a specific range and a specific cooldown preventing the chip to be used again during next Turn(s).
chips_3			If a chip effect is "Will remove 15 damage for 3 turns", the protection is active for the current turn (when the chip is activated) and the next 2 turns.
chips_4			Some chips have an area of effect. See CHIP_LIGHTNING for example. Damage will decrease linearly from the center cell (100% damage) to the border cells (50% damage).

farmer			Being a Farmer
farmer_1			In Leek Wars you play a Farmer.
As soon as you register you get a level 1 leek. Your goal is to defeat other leeks thanks to the coding and improvement of your AI using LeekScript.
farmer_2			Your leeks will earn Experience points after each fight. These Experience points will determine the level of your leeks. The higher your level, the better the chips and weapons you can use. When your level increases you can spend new capital points to upgrade your leek.
farmer_3			Later on in the game, you will have the opportunity to raise up to 4 leeks if you comply with the following:
farmer_4			1st leek: available as soon as registered.
farmer_5			2nd leek: 10,000 Habs / 1st leek at level 50.
farmer_6			3rd leek: 100,000 Habs / 1st leek at level 100 / 2nd leek at level 50.
farmer_7			4th leek: 1,000,000 Habs / 1st leek at level 150 / 2nd leek at level 100 / 3rd leek at level 50.
farmer_8			Reaching higher levels for your leek will allow you to use more LeekScript functions.
Each function is rated with a level which is displayed on the right of the function name in the <a href='/help/documentation'>documentation</a>. These level is the mimimum requested to be allowed to use this specific LeekScript function.
fights			Fights
fights_1			All information related to fights are available on the Garden page. There are 3 different kinds of fights:
fights_2			Solo fight (1 vs 1): one of your leeks is fighting another leek.
fights_3			Farmer fight: all your leeks fight all the leeks of another farmer.
fights_4			Team fight: one composition of your team is fighting another composition of another team.
fights_5			Royal battles : one of your leek is fighting 9 other leeks
fights_6			Your daily fights not been done on day can be postponed to the day after. If you cannot perform the fights (due to any other IRL constraint) you will have the opportunity to trigger them the day after. The postponing is done only the day after. If you do not perform your late fights the day after, they are definitively lost. For example, if you have no time today to do the <b>50</b> daily fights, you will then have the possibility to perform <b>100</b> fights tomorrow.
fights_7			The allowed number of fights is reset every day at midnight. (New fights for the new day, plus potentially the postponed fights from yesterday).
fights_8			Solo Fights
fights_9			In a <b>solo fight</b> your leek is against another leek which has mainly the same power (automatically calculated by the game).
fights_10			A fight will be counted, and removed to your remaining daily fights.
fights_11			Farmer Fights
fights_12			All your leeks fight all the leeks of another farmer.
fights_13			Although all your leeks fight, it counts only for a fight.
fights_14			Team Fights
fights_15			All the leeks inside a composition of your team fight together all the leeks of a composition of another team. Each of your leek is allowed to do <b>10</b> team fights with its composition, apart from your daily fights. A composition is allowed to fight only if all its leeks have at least 1 team fight left.
fights_16			Team fights do not add up to the total of your wins, draws and losses (ratio).
fights_17			Royal battles
fights_18			One of your leek is fighting 9 other leeks. Royal battles are available at the level 50. You can do them 
				as much as you want, but you jave to wait for 10 leeks registered.
				
fights_19			Royal battles reward no Experience point nor Habs. Royal battles do not add up to the total of your wins, draws and losses (ratio).

habs			Habs
habs_1			Hab(s) is the name of the Leek Wars currency. You earn Habs thanks to fights. You spend Habs to buy weapons and chips in the market, or to recruit an additional leek.
intro			This page will provide you with the detailed mechanisms regarding : leek evolution, fights, weapons, chips, tournaments...
If you are looking for the AI programming howto, you will find it on the LeekScript <a href='/help/tutorial'>Tutorial page</a>.
leeks			Leeks
leeks_1			Each leek can equip <b>weapons</b>, chips and an AI to fight.
leeks_10			Life steal = Wisdom / 10 (in %)
leeks_11			Strength
leeks_12			Strength increases attack damage (may it come from a weapon or a chip):
leeks_13			Attack damage = (initial damage) × (1 + Strength / 100)
leeks_14			Agility
leeks_15			Agility increases damage return and critical hits rate:
leeks_16			Final healing = (initial healing) × (1 + Agility / 100)
leeks_17			There are two kinds of shields: absolute shield and relative shield:
leeks_18			Absolute shield = (initial absolute shield) × (1 + Resistance / 100)
leeks_19			Relative shield = (initial relative shield) * (1 + Resistance / 100)
leeks_2			The look and feel of your leek will change over time when the level of your leek reaches some specific thresholds (getting older...)
leeks_21			Final damage = (initial damage) * (1 - Relative shield / 100) - Absolute shield
leeks_22			Movement Points
leeks_23			Movements Points determine the maximum of cells your leek is allowed to walk to at each Turn.
leeks_24			Turn Points
leeks_25			Turn Points is the maximum of action points your leek is allowed to spent for the use of weapons and chips, for talking, ... at each turn.
leeks_26			Frequency
leeks_27			The higher the Frequency, the luckier you are to play first during the fight.
leeks_28			Science
leeks_29			Science increases boosts and reduces shackles:
leeks_3			You may decide to remove your leek from the Garden to avoid any attack from other leeks for when you are on leave for example.
To do so, turn the Garden status switch from Yes to No on the leek page. Consequently your leek will never be presented to other leeks willing to fight "in the Garden".
leeks_30			Magic
leeks_31			Magic increases shackles and poisons:
leeks_32			Critical hit rate = Agility / 10 (in %)
leeks_33			Resistance
leeks_34			A critical hit increases effects by 40%.
leeks_35			Shields reduces directs attacks following the formula :
leeks_36			Resistance increases shields.
leeks_37			Boost = (Initial boost) × (1 + Science / 100)
leeks_38			Shackle = (Initial shackle) × (1 + Magic / 100)
leeks_39			Shackles are reduced by science following the formula:
leeks_4			A leek has several Attributes:
leeks_40			Finale shackle = Shackle × (1 + (Caster magic - Target science) / 100)
leeks_41			Poison damage = (Initial damage) × (1 + Magic / 100)
leeks_5			Life / Health Points
leeks_6			When the level of your leek increases, the life of this leek is increased by 5.
leeks_7			Wisdom
leeks_8			Wisdom increases healing and life steal:
leeks_9			Final Healing = (Initial healing) × (1 + Wisdom / 100)
market			Market
market_1			You can spend your Habs in the market to buy new weapons and chips.
market_2			As an example, the sheet of a chip looks like the following:
teams			Teams
teams_1			You may consider joining a team. A team is made of several farmers and allows you to perform team fights.
Joining a team is easy: display the team page and click on the "join the team" button displayed in the upper right. You may join a team that way only if this team has not forbidden open applications.
To quit your current team use the "Quit" button located on the lower right side of the team page.
teams_2			In a team leeks may be assigned to different compositions. Each composition is made of 6 leeks maximum. A team is limited to 40 farmers maximum.
teams_3			Captains
teams_4			A team has the ability to promote some of its farmers to the rank of Captain. Captains are allowed to managed compositions (create composition, add a leek, remove a leek, delete composition).
On the team page, you can see a little white star displayed in front of every Captain's name. The star is black for the team Creator.
teams_5			Logo and Motto
teams_6			A team logo and a team motto can be defined/modified by the team Creator and by the Captains. To modify a logo, click on it (there is a default logo). To modify the team motto, double-click in-between the quotes you can see just right after the logo.
title			Help
tournaments			Tournaments
tournaments_1			There are 3 kinds of tournaments:
tournaments_10			Team tournaments
tournaments_11			Your team can compete in team tournaments, in which the different compositions face each other. These tournaments start at 9 pm (French time) with 32 compositions each. A new round is generated every 30 minutes.
tournaments_12			To register one of your composition to a team tournament, click on the "tournament register" button on your team page.
The Experience points and Habs rewards are multiplied by a factor depending on the round your leek has reached. The further your composition goes, the better the multiplier (x2, x3, x4, x6 and x10).
tournaments_13			Team tournament: a team composition perform team fights at each tournament round (as long as they are not eliminated).
tournaments_2			Solo tournament (1 vs 1): your leek performs solo fights at each tournament round (as long as it is not eliminated).
tournaments_3			Farmer tournament: all your leeks perform farmer fights at each tournament round (as long as they are not eliminated).
tournaments_4			Solo Tournaments (1 vs 1)
tournaments_5			Each of your leeks can register to a daily solo tournament. Solo tournaments start at noon (French time) with 32 leeks. A new round is generated every 30 minutes.
tournaments_6			To register one of your leeks to a solo tournament, click on the "tournament register" button on the leek page.
The Experience points and Habs rewards are multiplied by a factor depending on the round your leek has reached. The further your leek goes, the better the multiplier (x2, x3, x4, x6 and x10).
tournaments_7			Farmer Tournaments
tournaments_8			As soon as you have 2 leeks, you can register to farmer tournaments. These are daily tournaments starting at 6 pm (French time) with 32 farmers each. A new round is generated every 30 minutes.
tournaments_9			To register your leeks to a farmer tournament, click on the "tournament register" button on your farmer page.
The Experience points and Habs rewards are multiplied by a factor depending on the round your leeks have reached. The further your leeks go, the better the multiplier (x2, x3, x4, x6 and x10).
trophies			Achievements
trophies_1			Achievements are rewarded to farmers upon completion of specific actions/results in the game. On your farmer page, you can sort your Achievements thanks to a button on the upper right side of the page. The two different criteria are: date of reward or Achievement number.
trophies_2			It's up to you now!
weapons			Weapons
weapons_1			Weapons are efficent to attack other leeks. Only one weapon can be taken in hands but a leek can carry up to 3 weapons (including the one in hands).
weapons_2			Each weapon requests a minimum level to be used. The use of a weapon costs a specific amount of Turn Points. Every weapon has also a failure percentage and a specific range. You can buy several occurences of each weapon in order to equip your different leeks with the same weapon. Your leeks are not allowed to fire more than one weapon at the same time. But one leek can of course fire one weapon, then replace it with another weapon, and then fire the new one (as long as it has enough Turn Points).
weapons_3			Some weapons have an area of effect. See "Grenade Launcher" for example. Damage decrease linearly from the center cell (100% damage) to the border cells (50% damage).
