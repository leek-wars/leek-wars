why			Why?

why_1			The project was born from the simple idea of two students, during an algebra course in college, who wanted to create a game based entirely on <b>programming</b>, concept not widespread at this time.
why_2			<b> Leek Wars </b> aims to place <b> programming </b> in the middle of a fun and entertaining browser only video game, easy to access, free and without advertising, wanting to offer to <b> beginners a nice platform </b> to discover the programming concepts, and a good challenge to <b> experienced coders</b>!
